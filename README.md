
# Infinite Scroll Weather Application

Built using Next js with Typescript and Tailwind css

#### NOTE: After clicking on the city name, wait for 5 to 7 seconds to get the weather details. Geonames API is limited so we can't add feature like infinite scrolling after fetching 100 city names from the Geonames database. If the weather details is not showing in the screen, then the name of the city is wrong or not available in the weather api database. Once the Weather details is fetched just refresh the page to get another city weaather details
